# Customer Segmentation using K-Clustering

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a businessâ€™s customers into groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors. It helps businesses personalize marketing, improve customer service, and increase customer retention and profitability.
K-means is efficient and easy to implement. It works well when the number of clusters is known or can be estimated, and when the data is numeric. It also scales well with large datasets compared to algorithms like hierarchical clustering.
